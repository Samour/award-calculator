**Definition of a day**

Someone might work these times: 8pm Monday - 4am Tuesday, 6pm-10pm Tuesday

Does the time worked "reset" at midnight, so they've worked 4 hours on Monday and 8 hours on Tuesday? Or would this be 10 hours for the first "day" then 2 hours on the second "day"

Another example: if someone works 8pm Monday - 8am Tuesday, is that a 12 hour "day" (OT applies), or a 4 hour day followed by 8 hour day ("resets" at midnight)

**Double-time pay**

Someone works 6pm-11pm on a Sunday

Does this count as:

6pm-9pm is time-and-a-half
9pm-11pm is double-time

Because:

- 6pm-11pm is OT because they worked outside of the alloted hours for a Sunday
- 9pm-11pm is DT because they did more than 3 hours of OT in a day

OR

6pm-11pm is time-and-a-half

Because:

- 6pm-11pm is OT because they worked outside of the alloted hours for a Sunday
- DT does not apply because they did not work more than 9 hours in a single day
