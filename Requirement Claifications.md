**12-hour gap between shifts**

Finally got back to this thing.

So consider someone that works a shift (lets say on a Monday) from 8am-10am, then another shift from 2pm-5pm. If they'd
worked a regular 6-hour shift, then it would all be paid at regular time. But because in this example they worked a
second shift within 12 hours of the first shift, their pay for this day would be 3 hours regular time + 3 hours overtime

Am I interpreting this correctly?

**9 vs 11 hours allowable per week**

> Second is that the can't work mor than 9 hours per day, except on one day a week which they can work up to 11 hours

Is this based on a calendar week, or in a 7-day span?

Eg. if someone works 10 hours on a Saturday then 10 hours on a Tuesday; does it all count as regular time (as the
"week" ticked over on Monday) or does the Tuesday get 1 hr overtime because it is within 7 days of the last time they
went over 9hrs in a day?
