**12-hour gap between shifts**

Finally got back to this thing.

So consider someone that works a shift (lets say on a Monday) from 8am-10am, then another shift from 2pm-5pm. If they'd
worked a regular 6-hour shift, then it would all be paid at regular time. But because in this example they worked a
second shift within 12 hours of the first shift, their pay for this day would be 3 hours regular time + 3 hours overtime

Am I interpreting this correctly?
