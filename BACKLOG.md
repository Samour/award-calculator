- Create export functionality for shift pay data to CSV
- When performing a paste with more rows on the clipboard than on the web UI, create sufficient rows to paste all of them
- Auto-fill common worker fields based on existing entries
- Transform into Progressive Web Application (Think this comes with CRA?)
